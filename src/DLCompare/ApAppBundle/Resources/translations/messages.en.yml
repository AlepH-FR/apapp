                DLCompare is a website and a gamer's price-comparison tool, but it's mainly a crew of really friendly nerdz. For allowing me to use their (awesome) servers, they should deserve some credits, right ?
            symfony: |
                Because Symfony 2 makes PHP developers feel like they were real developers !
            nb: |
                Nuit Blanche has been our gaming team... for 15 years... They always supported us.
            riot: |
                Because the game is fun, because the challenge is fun, and because it's rare to work on a project involving these two passions... thank you Riot !

            title: About the code
            text: |
                The code of this project has mainly been made thanks to Symfony 2 (PHP Framework), Doctrine 2 (PHP ORM & DBAL), jQuery (js), Highcharts (js).
                Symfony 2 vendors of the symfony-standard github project, and js vendors are the only pieces of code which weren't written exclusively for this project.

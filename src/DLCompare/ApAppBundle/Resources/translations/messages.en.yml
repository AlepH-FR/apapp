            Fighter:
                text: |
                    Fighter's category is a hard category to define. "AD champions with low range and not tanky enough to be considered as tanks". Some can be built Assassins (Poppy, Trynda, Vi), others tanks, others AP, others are team-oriented...<br />
                    Overall, the champions who can jump in on a squishy and terminate him (Vi, Poppy, Warwick, Yasuo, Wukong, Aatrox, Hecarim) are having a better time.<br />
                    Champions with no real "hard" engage are having a tougher one (Yorick, Olaf, Trynda, Pantheon, Udyr)
            Assassin:
                text: |
                    Assassin is a hard category to analyse.<br />
                    On one hand, AP assassins like Leblanc / Kassa / Akali are having a really hard time because they are not Rylai / Liandry type of champions.<br />
                    On the other hand, AD assasins are pretty much the same between the 2 patchs.
                    And on another (third?) hand, their is Nocturne.
            Marksman:
                text: |
                    Marksman are having a better time, maybe because Teemo is considered as a champion of this category, but he can be also classified as a Mage, or as an Assassin. Overall, the statistics havn't changed a lot.<br />
                    Some are having a better time because of their build moving between patches (Urgot, Twitch), other because of their adaptation to the meta (Sivir).<br />
                    The really funny thing is that nearly all the champions who are picked more in 5.14 see their win rate drop, while all the champions who are less used see their win rate rise. It looks like summoners should stick to their strong champions !
            Tank:
                text: |
                    3 champions have been upgraded thanks to the items modifications : Amumu because of Liandry / Rylai builds, Dr Mundo because he is an anti-AP beast, and Nasus for whatever reason.<br />
                    On the other hand, Skarner is having a hard time : it looks like Skarner summoners are going more into damage builds, resulting in a drop of his win rate.
            Mage:
                text: |
                    The global stats of Mage champions are quite the same between the 2 game versions. The global trend seems to be that Rylai / Liandry champions have been upgraded by the modifications 
                    of the AP items, while the other ones tends to fall of due to the drop of Spell Damage on their core items (Zhonya, Luden). Rod Of Ages champions are taking are serious hit too.<br />
                    It seems like summoners should play more Rylai / Liandry / Tear oriented champions like Rumble, Kennen, Morgana, etc.
            Support:
                text: |
                    Supports took a huge blow between the 5.11 and the 5.14 with the worst win rate drop of any type of champions.<br />
                    It looks like a lot of summoners went for more greedy AP builds on champions like Soraka or Zilean. 
                    But ther main reason is that Tahm Kench made the win ratio of the supports fall off by himself : he only has a 44.77% win rate on 5.14

                DLCompare is a website and a gamer's price-comparison tool, but it's mainly a crew of really friendly nerdz. For allowing me to use their (awesome) servers, they should deserve some credits, right ?

                Because Symfony 2 makes PHP developers feel like they were real developers !

                Nuit Blanche has been our gaming team... for 15 years... It's not a team any more. It's a family.
            riot: |
                Because the game is fun, because the challenge is fun, and because it's rare to work on a project involving these two passions... thank you Riot !
            highcharts: |
                Highcharts is an amazing library to build custom charts in svg. The number of options and possibilities is just AMAZING ! You should try it.
        code:
            title: About the code
            text: |
                The code of this project has mainly been made thanks to Symfony 2 (PHP Framework), Doctrine 2 (PHP ORM & DBAL), jQuery (js), Highcharts (js).
                Symfony 2 vendors of the symfony-standard github project, and js vendors are the only pieces of code which weren't written exclusively for this project.
            api: |
                <h3>Code and API</h3>
                The project is built with 3 separated bundles :<br />
                <ul>
                    <li>the main ApAppBundle which provides you have all these fine data analysis provided by the ...</li>
                    <li>A cache bundle... because the amount of data was huuuuuge !</li>
                    <li>LoLApiBundle, which can be reused by anyone.</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                This last bundle has been built as a configurable module to access LoL APIs and map them into entities.<br />
                <br />
                Even if it has limited functionnalities for the moment (only maps data to ORM and not ODM, some missing service on the API), it's highly configurable and evolutive.<br />
                Anyone wanting to help me develop this bundle, or use it for personnal projects can contact me. 
                <br />
                Given the delay of this challenge, i didn't had time to do more, but it can be an awesome tool for Symfony 2 users and LoL fans.<br />
                <br />
                The module is highly configurable and the code well documented for developers to work with it with ease.<br />
                More details about the api can be found here : <a href="https://github.com/AlepH-FR/apapp/blob/master/src/DLCompare/LoLApiBundle/Resources/doc/index.md"><strong>here</strong></a>
            methodology: |
                <h3>Methodology and timline</h3>
                The project was started a few hours after the challenge was announced.<br />
                <br />
                We picked the AP Items Challenge, which was pretty straight forward compared to other themes, for some reasons :
                <ul>
                    <li>because we wanted to have fun on a more graphical project</li>
                    <li>because we wanted to make a well-crafted state-of-the-art project</li>
                    <li>because we wanted to make an configurable opensource module out of this challenge, enabling Symfony 2 users to explore the LoL API</li>
                    <li>because we wanted to provide summoners (and ourselves) raw and refined data to help them pick the best champions with the best builds</li>
                    <li>because we wanted to see the impact of the AP items on the Mage champions obviously, but we wanted to provide data about its effect on the other non-AP champions, to see how the meta moves... and it's pretty interesting !</li>
                </ul>
                Azi began to work on the design and logo while AlepH started to work on the architecture.<br />
                <br />
                Then AlepH started to create scripts to import the most data possible to get the most accurate, and executed them while he was integrating the design.<br />
                <br />
                After that, we built the pages, and thanks to the AWESOME Symfony2, Doctrine 2 and Highcharts, this was pretty fast. Because the data imported is pretty big (400k games means 4 millions game players, means ~24 millions items purchased), we had to use caching to fasten page processing.
                Even if the statistical functions are part of the ApApp Bundle, we developped them so that it'll enrich the LoLApiBundle.<br />
                The entity repositories are full of function enabling developers to access any kind of statistics based on the data in their own database. We hope it will help a lot.<br />
                <br />
                Eventually, we had enough time to work on the analysis of this data.<br />
                Even if we could have gone for a global analysis, we thought that each champion having his own particularities, it would be better to get into the details and have an analysis for each champion.<br />
                Everyone can reach his own conclusions given the data we provide, but we thought it could be helpful for users to have a faster way to see the changes in each champion and item.<br />
